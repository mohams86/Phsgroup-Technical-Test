## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Extra Notes

I have worked on the below functionalities as per the task to build the simple order system.

(1) add products to a basket

(2) create the order form

(3) save the order to the database

I have used the project setup provided under this link https://gitlab.com/direct365_public/applicant-test only for the development. As there was some issue with Docker Engine error on my Windows system so I had to use the Wamp setup only for completing the task.

I have worked on the User login, User Signup and Logout functionalities as well. User will be able to add items into Cart and place an order after login only.

List of products will be fetched from products table based on the product seeder provided. I have used database migrations provided under the project setup provided under the Gitlab link only.

User will be able to see the Cart items count and options like Products list and Logout under the toggle menu appears by clicking on the logged in user's name under top header after login.

You will be able to see Laravel Application demo by using url http://127.0.0.1:8000 after setting up the project.

Please ensure that you're using PHP 8.2 in order to run the project.
